# Decision Log

## How to Use This Log
Document all significant architectural and design decisions.

**Format**:
- **Date**: When decision was made
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Context**: Why this decision was needed
- **Options Considered**: Alternatives evaluated
- **Rationale**: Why this option was chosen
- **Consequences**: Expected impact and trade-offs
- **Status**: Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded

---

## [2026-01-02] Database Choice: PostgreSQL

**Context**: Need to choose a database for the project. Requirements include:
- ACID compliance
- Good performance with relational data
- JSON support for flexible schemas
- Mature ecosystem

**Options Considered**:
1. **PostgreSQL** - Relational, ACID, JSON support
2. **MySQL** - Relational, widely used
3. **MongoDB** - Document store, flexible schema
4. **SQLite** - Simple, file-based

**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL

**Rationale**:
- Best balance of features for our needs
- Excellent JSON/JSONB support (flexibility + structure)
- Strong ACID guarantees
- Team has PostgreSQL experience
- Great tooling and extension ecosystem
- Better for complex queries than MongoDB
- More robust than SQLite for multi-user

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Strong data consistency
- ✅ Complex queries well-supported
- ✅ Can evolve schema as needed (JSONB)
- ⚠️ Requires proper hosting (not embedded like SQLite)
- ⚠️ Learning curve for advanced features

**Status**: ✅ Accepted

---

## [2026-01-05] API Framework: FastAPI vs Flask

**Context**: Choose Python web framework for REST API

**Options Considered**:
1. **FastAPI** - Modern, async, type hints, auto docs
2. **Flask** - Mature, simple, flexible
3. **Django REST** - Full-featured, batteries included

**Decision**: Use FastAPI

**Rationale**:
- Built-in async support (better performance)
- Automatic API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Type hints reduce bugs
- Modern Python practices
- Excellent for APIs (not general web apps)

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Better performance with async
- ✅ Type safety catches errors early
- ✅ Self-documenting API
- ⚠️ Smaller ecosystem than Flask
- ⚠️ Team needs to learn async patterns

**Status**: ✅ Accepted

### Stop Doing
- Last-minute PRs on Friday
- Skipping documentation

### Continue Doing
- Daily standups
- Clear sprint goals
- Code reviews
```

## Workflows

### Starting a New Project

1. **Create project structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs tasks sprints
   touch docs/PROJECT.md docs/ROADMAP.md docs/DECISIONS.md
   touch docs/MEETINGS.md tasks/BACKLOG.md tasks/TODO.md
   touch .claude/CLAUDE.md
   ```

2. **Initialize PROJECT.md** with project overview
3. **Create initial ROADMAP.md** with milestones
4. **Set up BACKLOG.md** with initial features
5. **Document first decisions** in DECISIONS.md

### Planning a Sprint

1. Review BACKLOG.md and select items for sprint
2. Create `sprints/sprint-XX.md` with sprint plan
3. Break down user stories into tasks
4. Assign tasks to team members
5. Update TODO.md with sprint tasks

### During Development

1. **Update TODO.md** daily with progress
2. **Log decisions** in DECISIONS.md as they're made
3. **Track meetings** in MEETINGS.md
4. **Update sprint file** with standup notes
5. **Move completed tasks** to DONE.md

### End of Sprint

1. **Sprint Review**: Document what was completed
2. **Sprint Retrospective**: Capture learnings
3. **Update ROADMAP.md**: Adjust if needed
4. **Archive completed tasks**: Move to DONE.md
5. **Plan next sprint**

### Tracking Progress

Check project health by reviewing:
```bash
# Recent decisions
tail -n 50 docs/DECISIONS.md

# Current tasks
cat tasks/TODO.md

# Sprint progress
cat sprints/sprint-XX.md

# Project status
head -n 100 docs/PROJECT.md
```

## Task Management Best Practices

### Priority Levels
- **P0 / Critical**: Blockers, bugs in production, must-haves for MVP
- **P1 / High**: Important features, significant improvements
- **P2 / Medium**: Nice-to-have features, minor improvements
- **P3 / Low**: Future considerations, ideas

### Task Sizing
- **S (Small)**: < 4 hours, single person, low complexity
- **M (Medium)**: 1-2 days, single person, moderate complexity
- **L (Large)**: 3-5 days, may need multiple people, high complexity
- **XL (Extra Large)**: > 1 week, needs breakdown into smaller tasks

### Status Indicators
- 📋 Not Started
- 🏗️ In Progress
- ⏸️ Paused / Blocked
- ✅ Done
- ❌ Cancelled

## Decision Making Framework

When making significant decisions:

1. **Document the context** - Why is this decision needed?
2. **List options** - What are all reasonable alternatives?
3. **Evaluate trade-offs** - Pros/cons of each option
4. **Make the decision** - Choose and document rationale
5. **Track consequences** - Note expected impacts
6. **Review periodically** - Validate or deprecate decisions

## Progress Reporting

### Weekly Status Update Template

## Integration with Git

### Commit Message Standards

Link commits to tasks and decisions:

```bash
# Reference task
git commit -m "feat: Add user registration endpoint

Implements user registration with email validation.
See tasks/TODO.md for acceptance criteria.

Closes #12"

# Reference decision
git commit -m "refactor: Switch to PostgreSQL

Implements decision from docs/DECISIONS.md [2026-01-02].
Migrates from SQLite to PostgreSQL for better scalability."
```

### Branch Naming

```
feature/user-authentication
bugfix/login-validation
docs/api-documentation
refactor/database-schema
```

## Automation Helpers

### Generate Weekly Report Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/weekly-report.sh

echo "# Weekly Report - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
echo
echo "## Completed Tasks"
grep "✅" tasks/TODO.md | head -10
echo
echo "## In Progress"
grep "🏗️" tasks/TODO.md
echo
echo "## Recent Decisions"
tail -n 20 docs/DECISIONS.md | grep "^## \["
```

### Check Project Health

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/project-health.sh

echo "Project Health Check"
echo "===================="
echo
echo "📊 Task Statistics:"
echo "- Total tasks: $(grep -c "^- \[" tasks/TODO.md)"
echo "- Completed: $(grep -c "^- \[x\]" tasks/TODO.md)"
echo "- In progress: $(grep -c "🏗️" tasks/TODO.md)"
echo "- Blocked: $(grep -c "⛔" tasks/TODO.md)"
echo
echo "📝 Documentation Status:"
echo "- Decisions logged: $(grep -c "^## \[" docs/DECISIONS.md)"
echo "- Meetings recorded: $(grep -c "^## 20" docs/MEETINGS.md)"
echo
echo "🎯 Current Sprint:"
ls -1 sprints/*.md | tail -1 | xargs cat | head -5
```

## Success Criteria

A well-managed project has:
- ✅ Clear PROJECT.md with goals and scope
- ✅ ROADMAP.md with defined milestones
- ✅ BACKLOG.md with prioritized features
- ✅ TODO.md updated daily
- ✅ DECISIONS.md documenting key choices
- ✅ MEETINGS.md with action items
- ✅ Regular sprint planning (if using sprints)
- ✅ Consistent documentation updates
- ✅ Clear task ownership and deadlines
- ✅ Blocked items identified and tracked
