WIRING REFERENCE
----------------
ESP32 GPIO 5  --> LED Strip Data (green wire)
ESP32 GPIO 13 --> PIR Sensor OUT
Power Bank 5V --> LED Strip VCC + ESP32 VIN + PIR VCC
All GNDs      --> Connect together

NOTES
-----
- LED Strip: IP30 for indoor, IP65 for outdoor/waterproof
- PIR Sensor: Set jumper to "L" (single trigger mode)
- Capacitor goes across LED strip power (VCC to GND)
- Resistor goes inline with data wire to first LED
